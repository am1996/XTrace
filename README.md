🌟 XTRACE: Intelligent, Compliant Track & Trace for Regulated Industries
------------------------------------------------------------------------
XTRACE is a powerful and robust track and trace software solution specifically engineered for organizations operating within stringent regulatory environments, such as pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical devices. It offers end-to-end supply chain visibility while guaranteeing adherence to the highest standards of data integrity and interoperability.

🛡️ CFR 21 Part 11 Enabled: Ensuring Data Integrity and Security
Designed with compliance as a core principle, XTRACE provides the technical controls necessary to meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 21 CFR Part 11 regulations for electronic records and electronic signatures. This capability ensures that your digital documentation is considered trustworthy, reliable, and equivalent to paper records.

Key 21 CFR Part 11 Features:

Secure Electronic Signatures: Implements unique electronic signatures that require dual-factor authentication (e.g., user ID and password) and are permanently linked to the electronic record, including the signer's name, date/time, and the meaning of the signature (e.g., approval, review).

Comprehensive Audit Trails: Automatically generates secure, computer-generated, and time-stamped audit trails. These logs independently record the date and time of operator entries and actions that create, modify, or delete electronic records, ensuring all changes are traceable and the original data is not obscured.

User Access Controls: Enforces strict authority checks and role-based permissions to limit system access and function use to only authorized and qualified individuals, protecting sensitive data.

System Validation Support: Provides the necessary documentation and structure (like detailed logs and reports) to support your Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) validation processes.

🔗 EPCIS Compliant: Universal Interoperability and Visibility
XTRACE leverages the global GS1 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard to revolutionize how supply chain events are captured and shared. EPCIS compliance ensures that product data is not only tracked but can be seamlessly shared and understood by trading partners worldwide, creating a unified language for traceability.

Key EPCIS Benefits:
===================

- Standardized Data Exchange: Captures and shares the critical "What, When, Where, and Why" of every product movement and status change using a globally recognized format.
- Enhanced Interoperability: Enables smooth, standardized data integration with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), and the systems of your trading partners (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, healthcare providers).
- End-to-End Traceability: Provides near real-time visibility into the chain of custody and ownership of serialized products, from raw material to patient, which is vital for quick response to recalls and for anti-counterfeiting efforts.
- Regulatory Framework Support: Facilitates compliance with major international traceability mandates that rely on GS1 standards, such as the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).
